# Bond-Pricer
A Monte Carlo-based bond pricer that leverages simulation techniques to provide accurate and comprehensive bond pricing by accounting for stochastic factors.

## Initialization

When the program is initially run the menu will appear like the following image.

## Face Value

In the 'Face Value' frame the user can input the dollar amount of the bond. The face value of a bond is the amount the issuer pays to the investor at maturity.

## Coupon Rate

In the 'Coupon Rate' frame the user can input the interest rate of the bond. The coupon rate is the fixed annual interest rate that the bond issuer agrees to pay to the bondholder.

## Maturity Date 

In the 'Maturity Date' frame the user can input an integer for the years until the bond will expire. The maturity date is the date on which the issuer of the bond is obligated to repay the face value of the bond to the bondholder.

## Payment Frequency 

In the 'Payment Frequency' frame the user can input an integer for how often the bond issuer makes interest payments to the bondholders.

## Model

After entering into all the frames click on the 'Calculate Bond Price' and the average of the Monte-Carlo simulation will be presented on the graph. In the top right corner, the price of the bond at maturity will be displayed.
